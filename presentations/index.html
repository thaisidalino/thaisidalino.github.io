  <h2>Presentations</h2>
  <p>I love to talk, I particularly love to talk about my research. I believe that communicating what we do in a comprehensive way is as important as the work itself, and this is the reason why I try to give as many talks as I can and I am always trying to improve my communication skills.</p>
<p>Here is a list of presentations I gave in the last few years:</p>
<p><strong>Conference talks:</strong></p>
