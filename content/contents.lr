I am a full time professor in Computer Science at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University and recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Ottawa. I place myself at the intersection of Combinatorics and Cryptography, with a special focus on developing new combinatorial objects with nice applications in cryptography.</p>
